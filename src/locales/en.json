Such loans are typically utilised to fund ongoing operations (akin to a Line of Credit, Working Capital Loan or Evergreen Facility). Lenders must therefore submit withdrawal requests to access any capital return. Term Loan means that there is a defined end date upon which Lenders will be fully repaid. This may, or may not, also include scheduled principal repayments throughout the term of the loan. Whilst repayment(s) occur without the need to submit withdrawal requests, the repayment profile is pre-defined, with little to no flexibility to submit ad-hoc withdrawal requests.
