A Token Locker must also participate in USDC lending and generate rKSU to be eligible for Protocol Fee Sharing. Token Lockers, who are also Lenders generating rKSU, are entitled to a share of 5% of the total gross interest earnings generated by lending activities on Kasu. Your proportionate share of this amount is determined by your rKSU balance relative to the total combined rKSU balance of all Lenders in the Kasu ecosystem. For example, in a scenario where a total of 1,000 rKSU from Lenders exists in the entire Kasu ecosystem, a Lender with a current balance of 150 rKSU (which is 15%) would be entitled to 15% of all Protocol Fees. This proportionality is augmented as more Lenders lock (or unlock) KSU to generate more rKSU (or burn more rKSU when unlocking), entitling them to a proportionate share of Protocol Fees."
